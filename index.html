			<p>From Jan. 2021 to Oct. 2021, the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) issued thousands of housing violations across the city. Compared to other boroughs, Brooklyn has some of the highest number of violations.</p>

			<p>While Class A (non-hazardous) violations are the most common type of violation, Brooklyn neighborhoods still have a disproportionate number of Class C (immediately hazardous) housing violations.</p>

			<p>Community boards 17 and 14 had the highest number of violations. Both are located in South Brooklyn and include the Flatbush, East Flatbush, Erasmus, and Ditmas Village neighborhoods.</p>

			<p>April Williams, the Principal Administrative Associate II for the Bronx HPD office, says this difference might be due to income differences across community districts. She uses the Bronx for comparison.</p>

			<p>“It’s the makeup, the people living in the areas,” said Williams. “Whether it’s renters or richer people. For example, Riverdale is going to be completely different from the South Bronx.”</p>
